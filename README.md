Hello boys

This is my first attempt at using GitHub except for the tutorial I just did. I am doing it following Arthur's suggestion, because as a physicist he is my authority on anything to do with computing.

What I am going to do is put in a minimum of code from the Dropbox, and rewrite from scratch any files that have been deleted, and then see if you two can make it work on your respective computers.

I will add to the readme when I have got this far.
